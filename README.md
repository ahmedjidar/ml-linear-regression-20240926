## ‚ú¶ [Introduction to Linear Regression](#introduction-to-linear-regression)

### Definition
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The primary goal is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

### Use Cases
```Linear Regression``` is widely used across various fields for its simplicity and interpretability. Some common use cases include:

- üè†Ô∏é **Predicting Housing Prices**: Estimating the price of a house based on features such as size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- üí≤**Sales Forecasting**: Analyzing historical sales data to forecast future sales based on marketing spend or economic indicators.
- ‚ùó**Risk Assessment**: Evaluating risk in finance by modeling the relationship between investment variables and returns.
- ‚öïÔ∏è**Healthcare Analysis**: Predicting patient outcomes based on factors like age, weight, and pre-existing conditions.

Linear Regression serves as a fundamental building block in machine learning and data analysis, making it essential for anyone looking to understand predictive modeling.

## Mathematical Foundations

Understanding the mathematical foundations of linear regression is crucial for effectively applying the technique in real-world scenarios. This section covers the essential components, including the equation, dependent and independent variables, and the types of linear regression.

### Equation of Linear Regression
At its core, linear regression seeks to establish a relationship between the dependent variable $\( y \)$ and one or more independent variables $\( x \)$. The equation of a simple linear regression model is given by:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- $\( y \)$: The predicted value of the dependent variable.
- $\( \beta_0 \)$: The y-intercept, representing the predicted value of $\( y \)$ when $\( x = 0 \)$.
- $\( \beta_1 \)$: The coefficient of the independent variable $\( x \)$, indicating the change in $\( y \)$ for a one-unit increase in $\( x \)$.
- $\( \epsilon \)$: The error term, capturing the variability in $\( y \)$ that cannot be explained by the linear relationship with $\( x \)$.

For multiple linear regression, the equation extends to accommodate multiple independent variables:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
$$

Where $\( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)$ are the independent variables.

### Dependent and Independent Variables
In the context of linear regression:

- **Dependent Variable (Response Variable)**: This is the variable we aim to predict or explain. It is dependent on the values of the independent variables.
- **Independent Variables (Predictors or Features)**: These are the variables used to predict the dependent variable. They are considered independent because their values do not depend on other variables in the model.

### Types of Linear Regression
There are two main types of linear regression:

1. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - Involves a single independent variable.
   - It aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points in a two-dimensional space (one predictor).

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   - Involves two or more independent variables.
   - It models the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple predictors, which can lead to more accurate predictions when relationships are complex.
