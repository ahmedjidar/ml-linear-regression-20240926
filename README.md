## [Introduction to Linear Regression](#introduction-to-linear-regression)

### Definition
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The primary goal is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

### Use Cases
Linear Regression is widely utilized across various fields for its simplicity and interpretability. Some common use cases include:

- **Predicting Housing Prices**: Estimating the price of a house based on features such as size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Analyzing historical sales data to forecast future sales based on marketing spend or economic indicators.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating risk in finance by modeling the relationship between investment variables and returns.
- **Healthcare Analysis**: Predicting patient outcomes based on factors like age, weight, and pre-existing conditions.

Linear Regression serves as a fundamental building block in machine learning and data analysis, making it essential for anyone looking to understand predictive modeling.
